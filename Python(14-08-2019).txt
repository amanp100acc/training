h = date(x.year, x.month, 1)

    lastFriday = now + relativedelta(weeks = -1, weekday = FR(-1))
    print("Previous friday was on: ", lastFriday)
else:
    lastFriday = now + relativedelta(weekday = FR(-1))
    print("Previous friday was on: ", lastFriday)

first_date = date(now.year, 1, 1)
print("The first date is: ", first_date.strftime("%d-%b-%Y"))
print("Present date: ", now.strftime("%d-%b-%Y"))
